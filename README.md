# UsbHost
PCB with MCU &amp; CC1101, with USB connector

This project is for manupulating Ostranna devices from PC using radio
This branch is for Magic Stick project. There are two devices in system, host and wand https://github.com/Kreyl/MagicStick.
Wand sends raw data from IMU to host and host may send commands to wand.

Protocol descrideb here (in Russian) https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Enq7OxXN71MnZqI4T44DpILLiYlTNmURxSFmcvyZTgg/edit

USB2Radio devices displays itself as virtual COM-port, you may user Terminal app to send commands or send commands from your code to serial port object. 

Archived branches are available here https://github.com/Kreyl/UsbHost/tags

We also have python module to work with USB2Radio  (in python folder).

  <summary>Commands list:</summary> 

*get_port_list() function returns list of available comports as ['COM3', 'COM5', 'COM20' ...];

*get_device_port function returns first found port with Ostranna device (answer 'Ack 0' to 'Ping\r\n') as 'COM4';

*get_all_device_ports() returns list of comports with Ostranna devices connected 
                        (answer 'Ack 0' to 'Ping\r\n') as ['COM4', ...];

*open_port(port_id: str) takes comport as str parameter (open_port('COM4') and returns open port or None;

*send command(ser, command, parameters) send command with parameters to ser port, returns send status
              ("ok", "Bad data", "Unknown command" or "No device port") ;

*send query(ser, command, parameters) send query with parameters to ser port and returns answer;

*close_port(ser) gets result of open_port(port_id) as parameter and closes it .
