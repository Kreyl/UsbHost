# UsbHost
PCB with MCU &amp; CC1101, with USB connector

This project is for manupulating Ostranna devices from PC using radio

This branch is for manipulating BigButtons while playing BrainRing 


Protocol descrideb here (in Russian) https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Enq7OxXN71MnZqI4T44DpILLiYlTNmURxSFmcvyZTgg/edit

USB2Radio devices displays itself as virtual COM-port, you may user Terminal app to send commands or send commands from your code to serial port object. 

Archived branches are available here https://github.com/Kreyl/UsbHost/tags

We also have python module to work with USB2Radio  (in python folder).

  <summary>Commands list:</summary> 

*get_port_list() function returns list of available comports as ['COM3', 'COM5', 'COM20' ...];

*get_device_port function returns first found port with Ostranna device (answer 'Ack 0' to 'Ping\r\n') as 'COM4';

*get_all_device_ports() returns list of comports with Ostranna devices connected 
                        (answer 'Ack 0' to 'Ping\r\n') as ['COM4', ...];

*open_port(port_id: str) takes comport as str parameter (open_port('COM4') and returns open port or None;

*send command(ser, command, parameters) send command with parameters to ser port, returns send status
              ("ok", "Bad data", "Unknown command" or "No device port") ;

*send query(ser, command, parameters) send query with parameters to ser port and returns answer;

*close_port(ser) gets result of open_port(port_id) as parameter and closes it .
